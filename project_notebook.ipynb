    "**Data Sets**: We will use two open source data sets which inlcude information about the housing market of the area of California. The first set contains information of the houses per quadrant based on longitude and latitude. The second set has information of specific houses and their specific address. "

    "**Process:** To be able to merge this two data bases we msut first clean the data by dropping any rows with key information such as its address/location and house features such as number of rooms and proximity to the coast. Additionally, the second date set is split between a training set and a testing set. We will concatenate the contents of these two, to then be able to merge it with the first data set"
